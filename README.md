## Overview

The advent of digital transactions and the widespread use of credit cards have revolutionized the way we conduct financial transactions. However, with the convenience of electronic payments comes the challenge of safeguarding against fraudulent activities, particularly in credit card transactions. Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to both financial institutions and consumers, necessitating advanced measures for detection and prevention.

This project, "Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning," aims to address this challenge by leveraging machine learning techniques to build a robust and efficient system for identifying potentially fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to develop a model that can analyze transaction patterns, detect anomalies, and contribute to enhancing the overall security of credit card transactions.
